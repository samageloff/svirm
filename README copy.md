# Slight Variations to create Illusions of Rhythmic Movements (SVIRM)

SVIRM started when I first discovered the works of the Argentina-born artist, Julio Le Parc. 

At the time, I had been focused on taking [Muzli Design Inspiration](https://medium.muz.li/) static interfaces, and making them "work" using React/Redux.

When I realized the amazing puzzle-like challenges that the Le Parc paintings posed, I was instantly hooked, and endeavored to re-create his works, using my current favorite tools: React, JavaScript and StyledComponents.
